            <h1>SALAD</h1>
            <p>Have you had your salad today? Eating salad almost every day may be one of the most healthy eating habits
                you can adopt -- and one of the simplest, experts say. Eating salads is a super-convenient way to work
                in a couple of servings of vegetables and/or fruit. Green salads are on the menu of almost every
                restaurant. Everyone knows how to make a green salad- just wash, dress, and toss. But very few know how
                to make a really nutritious, healthy salad. Making the perfect salad is a hidden skill that I’ve
                developed over the last 3 years from my job. I work at Saladworks and in this restaurant we are
                committed to making the freshest, best salads in America. With all the variety available,we make our
                salads with the cleanest ingredients and seasonal foods to keep our reputation of being ‘America 's Best
                Salads’. When it comes to your health, not all salads are created equal. In fact, many restaurant and
                fast-food salads are essentially calorie bombs disguised as healthy food- smothered in creamy, calorie
                dense dressings and missing important nutrients packed with powerful disease-fighting benefits.</p>

            <h1>PASTA</h1>
            <p> My favorite food is penne pasta. As I make this favorite dish, I can feel the last dry uncooked noodle
                of penne pasta fall off the palm of my hand into a boiling pot of water. Once the pasta is cooked, the
                penne is drained and steam rises from the hot moist noodles. The penne pasta noodles that I like are
                slightly soft and are ready for seasoning and flavoring with additional ingredients to appeal to the
                eyes and taste buds of the consumer.

                In looking at this amazing pasta dish, I can see the linear style pasta noodles that have come out of
                the box. I pour out the long penne noodles into the boiling water to cook for several minutes. Depending
                on the preference of the eater, one can cook the pasta al-dente or fully cooked to their individual
                perfection. I can see the pasta penne noodles pattern that is striated lines parallel to each other on
                each single noodle. While waiting for the pasta to cook, I prepare the ingredients to complement the
                penne pasta and I stir the reddish tomato paste for the final addition.

                While preparing this penne pasta, I move on to the cheese continuing to be busy as the water comes to a
                boil. I rub the block of Parmesan cheese on to a grater and hear the shaved cheese strands landing on a
                plate. When I hear the bubbly sounds come from the pot of boiling water, I know the water has come to a
                boil and it is time to begin adding the pasta. As the pasta cooks I steam vegetables to add to the
                pasta. The pasta is stirred in the pot once and a while so penne pasta noodles don’t stick to the bottom
                of the pot. I hear the squishy sounds of the penne noodle as the stirring spoon rubs noodles up against
                the inner walls of the pot. I can hear the noisy sounds of the spoon clinging against the pan as I stir
                the tomato sauce.</p>

            <h1>CHEAKPEA DRESSING</h1>
            <p>Thanks to the chickpeas, this salad will keep you full for hours. It's satisfying in a way that leafy
                greens never could be. Sorry not sorry, kale.

                Canned beans are the real MVP

                Canned beans are a real lifesaver when it comes to our favorite pantry staples. Each standard 15-oz. can
                comes packed with fiber and protein, providing a 1-2 punch of real affordable nutrition in the 30
                seconds it takes to crack open a can, drain, and rinse. They can be eaten straight from the can, making
                this a very summer-friendly recipe on those hot, hot days when you just can't be bothered to turn on the
                heat. We know that this is a "chickpea salad", but you can totally switch out chickpeas for your
                favorite canned beans: creamy cannellini beans, black beans, kidney beans are all great options.

                Make it your own

                Our lemon-parsley vinaigrette is perfectly tart and fresh with a hint of spice and you can put it on
                everything. This means that if you want to switch out any of the salad ingredients for your preferred
                addition, you have our blessings. Not a fan of olives or bell peppers? Cherry tomatoes and diced ripe
                avocado will fill that flavor gap. Want to keep it dairy free? Sub in another form of protein in place
                of the feta, like a couple of hard-boiled eggs or a can of tuna, or a handful of chopped toasted nuts.
                If you have any extra dressing left over, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 10
                days.</p>
